% This project presents structure for automated execution of SIMULINK models with different sets of input parameters
% project is divided into three parts:

    - prepareData.m - input data preparation for future simulations

    - runSimulations.m - running model under prepared conditions and saving results in resDir catalog

    - visualizeResults.m - simulations' results visualization

% Simulink model is not uploaded but its' stucture is attached as well as Figure with sample simulation results
